I thought it would be a good idea to have something we can try to make sure our environments can run it. And also some idea of how we might separate code into classes so several of us can work on stuff at the same time.

I had a guess at .gitignore but it's probably not right (I excluded the venv/ folder and only included actual source code/images.

built in pycharm
with pygame 1.9.6, python 3.8.2

run to try it: main.py
